# tmap Documentation

For large scale and integrative microbiome research, it is expected to apply advanced data mining techniques in microbiome analysis.

Topological data analysis(TDA) provides a promising technique for analyzing large scale complex data. The most popular *Mapper* algorithm is effective in distilling data-shape from high dimensional space, and provides a compressive network representation.

***tmap*** is a topological data analysis framework implemented of the *TDA Mapper* for population-scale microbiome data analysis. We developed ***tmap*** to enable easy adoption of TDA in microbiome data analysis pipeline,providing network-based statistical methods for enterotype analysis, driver species identification, and microbiome-wide association of host meta-data.
